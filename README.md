## Available Scripts

The project is built using React template of ASP.NET Core.

To run it locally with the server, you need to run the "dotnet run" command in the terminal from the server subdirectory. The client app will build automatically.

It can be done more easily if you use VS Code. Just press "F5" in the project dir to launch the server.
